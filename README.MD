This project is forked from [**GitProfile**](https://github.com/arifszn/gitprofile) with minor tweaks to features, themes, and layout. It is a personal portfolio that showcases my projects, code, work experience, certifications, and educational history.
It is built with React and is deployed in a Docker container. I try to keep it up to date with my latest projects and skills though I am mostly focused on school and other projects.
